Controllers - Taken from Module 7.1

It's good to think of the controller as something that handles the heavier logic in the application. A controller is usually a method or methods that will handle some or all of the following things:

    1. Receiving the incoming request depending on the route.

    2. Processing the type of incoming request: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

    3. Collecting the data from the incoming request.

    4. Working with the model to ensure that the requested data matches the types in the model and the database.

    5. Creating, updating, reading, or deleting objects in the database.

    6. Sending off the response for the incoming request.

    get() - Read - retrieves a record/resource
    
    put() - Update - allows modification(edit) of existing record/resource

    delete() - Delete - deletes/destroys existing record/resource
