Models - Taken from Module 7.1

Coding models are usually considered to be representations of the data being handled. Models can do the following:

    1. Represent the data being stored in the database.

    2. Dictate the types of data that will be stored (string, boolean, integer etc).

    3. Handle some basic business logic in an application, such as a character limit for a string being stored in the db, formatting for date and time details, and many other things that shape the data in the database.

    4. Used by the controller to handle logic.
